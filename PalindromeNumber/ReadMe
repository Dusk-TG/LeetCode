Project Discription:
Given an integer x, return true if x is a 
palindrome
, and false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

I converted the integer to a string and reversed it into a list for comparison.
I want to come back and do this in another language eventually.
